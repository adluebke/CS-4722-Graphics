The objective of this project was to alter PROVIDED code to create different effects on a sphere object.

1.) The first shader was to have a "glow" effect where the center is dark and color fades in towward the edges.
2.) The second shaderwas to have a "light ring" effect that makes the sphere appear as though it's directly under light.
3.) The third shader was to have a sort of "rainbow" effect where color radiates outword from vertices.
4.) The fourth shader was something we had to come up with outselves. I chose to make the sphere look like an eye.
